		<p2>When I came to this place, it made me feel like I was in the Ranch in New Zealand, so it is also called Little New Zealand. Since it is called the Desa Cattle Dairly Farm,of course there is a Kinabalu Mountain. The background of the ranch is the Kinabalu Mountain, due to the water vapor,the sacred mountain often hides shyly behind the counds. Seven o'clock in the morning is the best time to see the whole scene of the sacred mountain.</p2>

	<p3> Of course, in addition to enjoying the beautiful scenery and petting the cows, you must taste the freshest milk and various dairy products (yogurt and ltalian ice cream Gelato). In addition to the most basic flavors of milk, there are chocolate and coffee flavors, I highly recommend their original Ltalian ice cream, the dense textture and rich milk aroma, it is really enjoyable to bite down. I come on weekends and I saw the sales area here. There are long queues to taste the freshest milk and related products in Sabah.</p3>

	<center><h4><font face="Brush Script MT"><font size=20>Aplaca Club</h4></center>
	<p9>When I came to Kundasang, I also visit Alpaca Club. The time limit for visiting the park here is 20 minutes, this is can feed, touch the alpacas and take pictures with alpacas. The worker reminded us never touch its head or butt, or you might get kicked or spit on.( I forgot how much the entrance fee is, anyway it is very expensive.)</p9>

	<p10> Regarding the accommodation, I highly recommend Alpero's villa, which is a fmous hotel with a view of Mount Kinabalu. The interior decoration is also good, with a wide field of vision,which is very suitable for taking pictures.</p10>
